## Goals of data analytics
- What is happening?
- What is the effect of the occuring phenomenon/pattern?
- What will happen next?

## What is going to happen in the future of data analytics?
### Data mining
- Better than gold baby.
- Take a large data base and look for patterns

## Process of acquiring data
- Selection of data
- Preprocessing
- Transformation
- Data mining
- Evaluation/Interpretation
== KNOWLEDGE

## What is Machine learning?
- Iterative method of exposing an iterative mathematical formula (usually statistical models, like mean and standard deviation) to newer data and seeing how the algorithm learns from it's previous data and how it re-classifies it.

### Supervised Learning
- We provide the training data
- The tasks from data mining that helps with this is classification and prediction
- S.L is all about looking at data and classifying everything that is important

## Types of data
### Structured Data
- Data with high degree of organization

### Unstructured Data
- Data with very low degree of organization

## Important terminology for databases
### Element
- Object from which the measurement is taken

### Population
- Collection of elements

### Sampling Units
- Unique collections of elements that end up covering the population

### Sampling frame
- List of sampling units

## Errors of Non-observation
### Sampling error
- Deviation between estimate and the true population value
- The sampling frame will not meet with the errors of coverage

# SKIPPING ALL STATISTICS THINGS (Critical Value Approach)
- Rejecting null hypothesis when it should be true is better than the opposite

## Image recognition with neural networks
### First few layers look for small artefacts
### Next few layers generalize and look for larger artefacts
### Eventually you want the final layer to tell you the name of the person in the picture

## Architectures for Neural Networks
### FFNs
### CNNs
- Made for computer vision

### RNNs
- Sequence modeling
- Nationality identifying from an audio file of a person speaking

### Library we will use is Scikit-Learn
